# La-Salle-University-Remodel
I did a comparison from our website to other colleges around the country and ours was lackluster compared to them. I made it so our website is responsive and less congested. I added a few other changes such as an updated quick links section, the student life section can now be easily accessed, facts about our campus can now be easily seen. Also, I added an affordability section so that it is not hidden from the person viewing the website, and finally I added a carousel full of images that show La Salle in various different settings. I had heard that the new president of La Salle was looking to move La Salle forward, and I felt that I would need to show her that there are ways to put La Salle ahead of the competition or at least compete with our competition. Although, my website that I created is not perfect I do believe that it is a solid start into something better. I would hope that my changes would be adapted to the current website, but if not I am glad to have put myself in a situation where I made a website for something that has been a part of me every day for the past four years. In the end my major motivation was to move my college in a positive direction.
